Do Step 1 - Those 3 words only as a command will instruct the agent to begin an interview process and subsequently generate your SRS.

Do Step 2 - Another three word command. This one will use the SRS created in Step 1, interview you a bit more, and then generate a PRD.

Do Step 3 - This command will take the PRD from Step 2, possibly ask a few clarifying questions, and then produce a comprehensive Task List file for you.

Do Step 4 - This command will analyze everything created thus far and produce a Tech Stack document. Inside of the Tech Stack document will be a host of links to explainer files that are also created. The explainers go into more depth about each component of the Tech Stack.

Do Step 5 - Finally... This command will instruct the AI to begin working on each step of the Task list. Recommended prompt is "Do Step 5: 1.1 through 1.3". This will start the build process in a slow controlled way. We recommend you open the Task List file in your editor and follow along. As items are completed, the AI will check them off. As you are comfortable, subsequent prompts along the way will then be "Do 1.4 through 1.10" or "Do the remainder of 1.x".
